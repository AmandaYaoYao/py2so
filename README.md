# py2so

## What is py2so
1. py2so is tool to change the .py to .so, you can use it to hide the source code of py
2. py2so can transfer a single file, more of this, it can certainly transfer the whole project at one time!
3. The .so file generated by the .py file can be called by the main func as "from module import * "
4. py2so can detect the .py file and transfer to .so file, also you can determin which file or directory you don't want to change
5. You can also determin whether keep the source py.
6. Considering the probality of the user's fault to delete the source .py file, py2so provide a copy of the source to avoid it, the name of it tends to be end with "_old"
6. py2so needs the environment of python2
